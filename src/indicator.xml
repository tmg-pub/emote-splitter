  <!-- This is to set up the little "Sending..." indicator in the bottom left 
        corner of the screen. It's a bit easier to do little things like this
        right in the Lua source, but this would be technically the more
        proper way. Maybe the graphic designers have an easier time working
        with templates like this rather than dealing with programming code. -->

  <!-- While we could just make a font string right on the UIParent, having our
        own frame for it might be considered a little less funky. Plus, I don't
        think you can do it that way in Lua. A common mistake is to not anchor
        things to the UI Parent; not doing that causes two major problems that
        aren't easily noticable at first (but very obvious once you
        understand). One, the frame isn't scaled right. The UI Parent will
        scale coordinates (by default) to equal your screen resolution. Your 
        frames will typically appear bigger. Two, your frame won't be hidden
        when you press Alt-Z. Only things that are children of the UI Parent
        are. -->
