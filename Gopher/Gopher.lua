-- All Rights Reserved.
--
-- See api.lua for the public API.
--
-- Here are the key features that this library provides:
--   * Allows SendChatMessage  and  other  similar methods  to  accept messages
--      larger than  255  characters,  and automatically  split  them up.  Also
--      splits up messages with "\n" or  literal newlines in them to be sent as
--      their own message.
--   * Robust message queue system  which  re-sends failed messages.  Sometimes
--      the server might give you  an  error  if  you send messages immediately
--      after the last.  Gopher works around that by saving  your  messages and
--      verifying the response from the server.
--   * Support  for  all  chat types.  Alongside  public  messages,  Gopher  is
--      compatible  with  the  other  chat  channels.  Gopher also ensures that
--      messages will  be  received in order that they're sent,  and corrects a
--      quirk with Battle.net whispers. Weak support for global channels.
--   * Seamless feel. Gopher should feel like there's nothing going on.
--     It hides  any error messages from  the  client,  and  provides  its  own
--      throttle library to ensure that outgoing chat is your #1 priority.

-- Here's our chat-queue system. 
--
-- Firstly we have the actual queue. This table contains the user's queued
--  chat messages they want to send.
--
-- Each entry has these fields. Most of these are the arguments you may pass
--  to SendChatMessage.
--    msg: The message text.
--    type: "SAY" or "EMOTE" etc.
--    arg3: Language index or club ID.
--    target: Channel, whisper target, BNet presence ID, or club stream ID.
--    prio: Message priority (lower numbers are sent before higher numbers).
--    id: Unique message ID. In the future this will help coordinate between
--         queues.
-- We have multiple channels to send messages of different types, since they
--  use different verification methods. For example, you can send a club 
--  message and a say message at the same time. This may be undesirable due
--  to unpredictable message ordering, but you can prevent that by inserting
--  a BREAK in the queue. (See QueueBreak)
--  
-- Queue 1: SAY, EMOTE, YELL, BNET
-- Confirmation: CHAT_MSG_SAY, CHAT_MSG_EMOTE, CHAT_MSG_YELL, 
--                CHAT_MSG_BN_WHISPER_INFORM
-- Failure: CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM
-- Fatal: CHAT_MSG_BN_WHISPER_PLAYER_OFFLINE
--
-- Queue 2: GUILD, OFFICER, CLUB
-- Confirmation: CHAT_MSG_GUILD, CHAT_MSG_OFFICER, 
--                CHAT_MSG_COMMUNITIES_CHANNEL
-- Failure: CLUB_ERROR
-- Queue 3: DELETE/EDIT
-- Confirmation: CLUB_MSG_UPDATED
-- Failure: CLUB_ERROR
--
-- This is so that if you do SendChatMessage and then C_Club.SendMessage
--  at the same time, we can send both of these messages together. It's
--  mostly a feature meant to help Cross RP send its messages in unison.
--  Minimal improvement for normal cases.

-- The way we dequeue is a little complex. It's not a plain FIFO anymore.

-- Then, we try to keep our channels busy, and different channel types can
--  be sent in tandem. If you want to pair messages together, use a queue
--  break to halt the system until everything is free.
--
-- The guarantees provided are:
--   Chat messages of higher priorities are sent before lower priority.
--   Each channel's messages will always be sent and arrive in-order.
--   Using queue BREAKS, you can also guarantee message ordering cross-channel
--    or send messages together.

--   CLUB  SOMETHING     \ Sent together with next batch.
--   BREAK               -- Cuts grouping.
--   SAY   HELLO         \ Sent together properly.
--   CLUB  RELAY_HELLO   /
--
